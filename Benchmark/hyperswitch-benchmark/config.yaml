# Configuration file for Inference and Evaluation

# API Configuration (used as defaults for API-based models)
api:
  base_url: "https://grid.ai.juspay.net/v1/messages"
  api_key: "add_your_api_key_here"

# Model Configuration
# These are suggested model names that will be used as defaults during interactive setup
# You can configure as many models as you want (1-10) during script execution
models:
  # Model names for inference and evaluation
  model_1: "glm4-base"  # Change this to a valid model name on your API
  model_2: "glm-latest"
  evaluation_model: "glm-latest"  # Change this to a valid model name on your API
  
  # Example: Add more model names here for quick access
  # model_3: "gpt-4"
  # model_4: "claude-3-opus"
  # model_5: "llama-3-70b"

# Generation Parameters
generation:
  temperature: 0.6
  top_p: 0.95
  top_k: 20  # Set to null if not supported by API
  max_tokens: 10000
  num_outputs: 3  # Number of outputs per data point

# Evaluation Parameters
evaluation:
  temperature: 0.0  # Use temperature 0 for consistent evaluation
  max_tokens: 1600
  top_k: null
  top_p: null

# Concurrency Configuration
concurrency:
  max_concurrent_items: 5  # Number of items to process in parallel (recommended: 3-10)

# Processing Configuration
processing:
  max_workers: 1  # Number of parallel workers for evaluation
  enable_parallel: false  # Enable parallel processing

# File Paths (relative to project root)
paths:
  input_file: "data/input.json"
