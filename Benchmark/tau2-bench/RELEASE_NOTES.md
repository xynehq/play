# Release Notes

Welcome to the τ²-bench release notes! Here you'll find user-friendly summaries of what's new, what's changed, and what you need to know for each release.

## Version 0.2.1 - Reinforcement Learning Support 🤖

**Release Date**: November 2025

### 🎮 Gymnasium Integration

τ²-bench now supports reinforcement learning with a standard Gymnasium-compatible interface!

#### 🌟 What's New
- **Train RL Agents**: Use `AgentGymEnv` and `UserGymEnv` with popular RL frameworks
- **Interactive Play Mode**: New `tau2 play` command lets you control the agent or user manually
- **Train/Test Splits**: Standardized task splits across all domains for proper evaluation
- **Backward Compatible**: Use `base` task split to evaluate on the complete original τ²-bench task set
- **Enforce Communication Protocol**: Optionally enforce communication protocol rules (e.g., no mixed messages with text and tool calls)

#### 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
# Try interactive play mode
tau2 play

# Use programmatically with gym interface
from tau2.gym import AgentGymEnv, UserGymEnv
```

See the [Gym Documentation](src/tau2/gym/README.md) for detailed usage examples and API reference.
