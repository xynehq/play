## v0.1.1 (2025-09-04) - Stability & Testing Improvements

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### Functional Tests Fixed
- **Fixed `test_full_pipeline_produces_valid_training_data`**: Now handles small validation datasets gracefully by allowing validation files to be empty for small test datasets
- **Fixed `test_process_fails_with_invalid_data`**: Improved error message assertion to check both stdout and stderr for more reliable error detection
- **All 10 functional tests now pass consistently** with improved edge case handling

#### TensorBoard Integration Fixed
- **Fixed `make train-bnb-tb` command termination**: Resolved issue where `pkill` commands were causing the make process to terminate unexpectedly
