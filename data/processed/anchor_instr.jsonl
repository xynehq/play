{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do you evaluate a machine learning model?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Model evaluation involves metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification, or MSE and RÂ² for regression. Cross-validation and holdout test sets help assess generalization."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain the bias-variance tradeoff."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The bias-variance tradeoff describes the balance between a model's ability to capture true patterns (low bias) and its sensitivity to training data variations (low variance). Optimal models minimize both."}]}
