```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and classes
- Mock external dependencies
- Fast execution (< 1 second per test)
- Located in `tests/test_*.py`

#### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows
- Use real data when possible
- May be slower and require GPU
- Mark with `@pytest.mark.integration`

#### Functional Tests
- Test CLI commands and Makefile targets
- Verify end-to-end functionality
- Located in `tests/test_commands.py`

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from pathlib import Path

class TestNewFeature:
    """Test suite for new feature."""
    
    def test_basic_functionality(self, sample_config):
        """Test basic functionality works."""
        # Arrange
        config = sample_config
        
        # Act
        result = process_config(config)
        
        # Assert
        assert result is not None
        assert result.success is True
    
    @pytest.mark.gpu
    def test_gpu_functionality(self):
        """Test GPU-specific functionality."""
        # GPU test code
        pass
    
    @pytest.mark.slow
    def test_performance(self):
        """Performance test (marked as slow)."""
        # Performance test code
        pass
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=scripts --cov-report=html

# Run specific categories
pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only
pytest -m "not slow"    # Skip slow tests
```

## üìö Documentation Guidelines

### Types of Documentation

#### Code Documentation
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include parameter types and return values
- Add examples for complex functions

```python
def train_model(config: Dict[str, Any]) -> TrainingResult:
    """Train a language model with the given configuration.
    
    Args:
        config: Training configuration containing model, data,
            and training parameters.
    
    Returns:
        TrainingResult: Object containing training metrics and
            model artifacts.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If configuration is invalid.
        RuntimeError: If training fails.
    
    Example:
        >>> config = load_config("configs/run_bnb.yaml")
        >>> result = train_model(config)
        >>> print(result.final_loss)
        0.85
